# AQSNet: On the automatic quality assessment of annotated sample data for object extraction from remote sensing imagery ##[Paper Address](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924271623001430)

AQSNet is a novel and automatic Annotation Quality aSsessment Network (AQSNet) for remote sensing data, where the goal is to assess the quality of annotated remote sensing samples (e.g., building, waterbody, and other object class datasets). This paper’s main contributions include three points. 1) To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a fully automated method for the AQS of RS datasets. 2) A massive RS dataset, HBD4, and its manually constructed WAQS dataset are made publicly available to the research on objection extraction, land cover classification, and automatic quality assessment of RS annotated samples. 3) Our proposed method has been successfully applied in two application scenarios. On the one hand, we present a new strategy for generating simulated samples, which yields promising accuracy while significantly reducing the use of real-world training samples. On the other hand, our proposed method provides high-quality and massive samples automatically for related RS applications, such as building and water extraction.
