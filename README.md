# AQSNet: On the automatic quality assessment of annotated sample data for object extraction from remote sensing imagery

AQSNet is a novel and automatic Annotation Quality aSsessment Network (AQSNet) for remote sensing data, where the goal is to assess the quality of annotated remote sensing samples (e.g., building, waterbody, and other object class datasets). We will release our source code and two constructed AQS datasets when our paper is accepted in the near future.

## Providing Datasets 
*  Hubei Land Cover Satellite DataSet: [HBD4](http://58.48.42.237/luojiaSet/datasets/datasetDetail/77?id=77&taskType=lc)
